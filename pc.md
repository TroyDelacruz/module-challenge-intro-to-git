## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
A: Distributed version control that assists and promotes collaboration with efficiency and speed in mind.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
A: Git is the version control software. GitHub is used with repositories that can be used with Git to publicize coding programs on the internet.
3. Why do we create a branch?
A: To seperate other people's work depending on software, location, and overall simplicity. You want to make a branch so others and yourself can merge these branches to the main one depending on the situation.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A: To take and clone a GitHub repository to make a remote branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
A: git checkout with the specified name or git switch with the same conditions.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
A: git fetch updates your remote-tracking branches, git pull brings a local branch up to date with it's remote branch, while also doing the additional effect similar to git fetch. git merge joins two branches together.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A: Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
A: The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes. After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content. The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
